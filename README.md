Objective

To collect, analyze, and visualize bus travel data from Redbus using Selenium for scraping and Streamlit for dynamic filtering.

Skills Developed
- Web Scraping with Selenium
- Python Programming
- SQL for Data Storage
- Streamlit for Web Applications

Business Use Cases
- Travel Aggregators: Real-time bus schedules and seat availability.
- Market Analysis: Insights into travel patterns and preferences.
- Customer Service: Customized travel options based on data.
- Competitor Analysis: Comparison of pricing and service levels.

Approach

1. Data Scraping
   Automate data extraction from Redbus (routes, schedules, prices, seat availability).

2. Data Storage
   Store the data in a SQL database.

3. Streamlit Application
   Develop an application to display and filter data.
   Implement filters such as bus type, route, price range, star rating, availability.

4. Data Analysis/Filtering
   Retrieve and filter data using SQL queries.
   Enable interactive data filtering via Streamlit.
