# Project Overview

## Objective

To collect, analyze, and visualize bus travel data from Redbus using Selenium for scraping and Streamlit for dynamic filtering.

## Skills Developed
- Web Scraping with Selenium
- Python Programming
- SQL for Data Storage
- Streamlit for Web Applications

## Business Use Cases
- Travel Aggregators: Real-time bus schedules and seat availability.
- Market Analysis: Insights into travel patterns and preferences.
- Customer Service: Customized travel options based on data.
- Competitor Analysis: Comparison of pricing and service levels.

## Approach

**1. Data Scraping**
   Automate data extraction from Redbus (routes, schedules, prices, seat availability).

**2. Data Storage**
   Store the data in a SQL database.

**3. Streamlit Application**
   Develop an application to display and filter data.
   Implement filters such as bus type, route, price range, star rating, availability.

**4. Data Analysis/Filtering**
   Retrieve and filter data using SQL queries.
   Enable interactive data filtering via Streamlit.
